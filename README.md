# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. Whether you're looking for a casual movie night suggestion or a tailored list based on your unique preferences, this system has you covered.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest movies you'll love.
- **Data Processing**: Efficiently handles large datasets, including movie metadata and user ratings.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive and easy-to-use interface for users to get recommendations quickly.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing amounts of data and user interactions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for the recommendation algorithms and system implementation.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models and scripts for training new models.
- `docs/`: Documentation and resources to help you understand and use the system.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakshamsaraf23/Movie-Recommender.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the System**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
3. **Run app.py**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   

## How It Works

The Movie Recommendation System combines collaborative filtering techniques, such as matrix factorization, with content-based filtering methods to deliver accurate and personalized movie suggestions. The system learns from user ratings and movie metadata to understand preferences and predict future ratings.

## Datasets

This project utilizes publicly available datasets TMDB Movies Dataset. Additional data sources can be integrated to enhance recommendations.
